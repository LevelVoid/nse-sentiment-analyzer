"""
Cascade/Ripple Tracking — commodity → affected-sector detection.

When news mentions a commodity (crude oil, gold, rupee, iron ore),
this module flags which NSE tickers are indirectly affected and why.

Design:
  - CASCADE_MAP defines each commodity driver, its direction (rise/fall),
    and the tickers it impacts with a human-readable reason.
  - Keyword matching happens against news text that is *already fetched*
    by the sentiment pipeline — no extra network calls.
  - detect_cascade() returns simple dicts consumed by render.py.

# Each commodity's tickers are a list of (symbol, impact_reason).

# direction_up / direction_down are scanned in matched article text to infer
