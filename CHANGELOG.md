# Changelog

## [2.5.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Indian financial lexicon expanded to 123 terms** — Added 53 new entries across 10 categories:
  - IPO/capital markets: oversubscribed, undersubscribed, listing
  - Banking/NPA: slippage, provisioning, moratorium, recapitalization, infusion, pledged, unpledged
  - Fund flows: inflow, outflow, buying, selling
  - Results: doubled, tripled, multibagger, topline, bottomline
  - Corporate governance: mismanagement, compliance, scrutiny
  - Corporate action: buyout, merger, acquisition, delisting
  - Macro: depreciation, appreciation, deficit
  - Hinglish: tej, mand, gire, giri, chade, chadi
  - Fixed wrong-direction VADER scores: "profit warning" now correctly negative (+0.128 → -0.103), "overweight" now correctly positive (-0.361 → +0.361)
- **REGULATORY_APPROVAL event type** — "SEBI clears merger", "RBI approves", "CCI okays" are now classified as positive events (base +0.15) instead of falling through to LITIGATION. Catches 5 regulatory bodies across 5 patterns.
- **LiveMint Companies and Industry RSS feeds** — Two additional source feeds from livemint.com to improve news coverage depth.

### Changed
- **Disclaimer updated** — Sentiment model and event classifier limitations now reflect the expanded lexicon and REGULATORY_APPROVAL fix. "SEBI clears merger" example updated from "flagged as penalty" to "correctly classified as regulatory approval".
- **License changed from MIT to AGPL v3** — Prevents closed-source monetization while allowing open sharing.
- **Landing page** — Metrics updated: 9+ data sources, 19 event types, 135 tests, AGPL v3 license. Lexicon count updated throughout docs.
- **README** — Lexicon count synced to 125-term across overview and architecture diagram.

## [2.4.2] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- **Shareable snapshot links now work** — `?ticker=NIFTYBEES` URLs crashed with a `TypeError` because the rendering pipeline wasn't setting up technical indicators and other supporting data for snapshot-only visits. Now they load the same full dashboard as a normal search.
- **`get_cached_history` import was inline-only** — Couldn't be reached from the snapshot code path without a separate inline import. Promoted to module-level import so all paths can use it.

### Cleaned
- **Function-level imports moved to module level** — `sentiment.py` was importing from `persistence` inside a function body (leftover from an old circular-dependency scare). `intraday.py` had `import yfinance` inside two separate functions. Both now import at the top of the file — cleaner, faster, and more predictable.
- **PEP 8 spacing** — Trimmed extra blank lines between functions in `render.py`.

## [2.4.1] — 2026-06-21

### Security
- **HTML escaping extended** — `h()` now escapes single quotes (`'` → `&#39;`) in all rendered output. Prevents XSS via ticker names in shareable `?ticker=` links.
- **Ticker query param validation** — `?ticker=` URL parameter is now validated against `^[A-Z0-9&-]+$` before any API call. Invalid tickers show a warning instead of triggering yfinance lookups.

### Fixed
- **RSS feed timeout** — `feedparser.parse()` now uses `timeout=10` to prevent a single slow RSS source from hanging the entire analysis pipeline indefinitely.
- **DuckDuckGo rate-limit cooldown** — Separate 60s cooldown added for DDGS fallback. If DDGS returns a captcha/error page, all subsequent DDGS calls skip for 60s.
- **Thread-safe rate-limit cooldown** — `_RATE_LIMITED_UNTIL` is now protected by `threading.Lock`, preventing races when briefing mode runs 5 parallel workers.
- **Retry skips sleep during cooldown** — If yfinance calls enter a global rate-limit cooldown during retry backoff, the sleep is skipped so retries happen faster instead of burning time.

### Changed
- **Contact info consolidated** — Email, X handle, and Chai4Me URL are now in a single `CONTACT` dict at the top of `app.py`. All 5 references (sidebar, footer, privacy policy, disclaimer, Chai4Me button) draw from it.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Rate limiter** — Per-session throttle (6 searches/minute) prevents rapid-fire clicking from burning through shared yfinance quota under multi-user load. Warning message shows cooldown remaining.
- **Cache pruning** — `cache.json` capped at 500 entries. Oldest entries evict automatically when limit exceeded, preventing unbounded file growth on multi-tenant Streamlit Cloud.
- **Streamlit config** — `.streamlit/config.toml` with `maxCacheSize=250`, CORS, XSRF, and dark theme baked into the Streamlit Cloud build settings.

### Changed
- **VWAP skipped during rate-limit cooldown** — `compute_vwap()` fires a separate `yf.download()` call. Now it's gated behind the same rate-limit cooldown as stock data fetches. Reduces yfinance pressure when already rate-limited.

### Cleaned
- Removed 7 dead variables in `app.py` — `stock_data`, `headline_scores`, `signal`, `avg_compound`, `signal_emoji`, `source_stats`, `confidence`. These were orphaned when the old inline rendering was extracted to `render_dashboard()`.
- Removed unused `import os` from `data_fetcher.py`.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Lucide SVGs in card titles and footer** — Replaced emojis with Lucide folder, bar-chart, check, x, and mail icons in the bottom dashboard cards
- **ATP parse failure feedback** — Non-numeric entry prices now show a warning instead of silently adding the stock without a price
- **Briefing button loading state** — Both sidebar and bottom briefing buttons disable while running to prevent double-trigger
- **Thread-safe file locking** — `threading.Lock` added to `save_sentiment_history` and `update_source_accuracy` to prevent data loss during concurrent portfolio briefing

### Changed
- **Briefing is 5× faster** — `analyze_ticker()` now accepts `quick=True` for briefing mode, skipping all news fetching (9 RSS feeds + DuckDuckGo + Reddit). Per-ticker: ~9s → ~1.5s. Workers increased from 3 to 5.
- **Portfolio/Track Record cards moved to bottom** — Dashboard cards now appear after analysis results (below institutional flow) instead of above the ticker input
- **Ticker validation now accepts hyphens and ampersands** — `str.isalnum()` replaced with `re.match(r'^[A-Z0-9&-]+$')`. BAJAJ-AUTO, M&M, J&KBANK etc. can now be added.

### Fixed
- **Briefing not running** — Stale ticker text in the search input hijacked the if/elif chain, causing the analysis block to run instead of briefing. Briefing now clears stale ticker state.
- **Bottom "Briefing" button was dead** — ⚡ Briefing button had no `if` condition. Clicking it did nothing. Now wired to `st.session_state.run_briefing`.
- **Stale vote indicator** — `elif` for vote status didn't check `last_rec["ticker"] == final_ticker`, showing the wrong ticker's vote. Fixed.
- **30+ regulator aliases removed from news matching** — RBI→SBIN, SEBI→SBIN, DGCA→INDIGO, TRAI→BHARTIARTL, FDA→SUNPHARMA etc. caused false-positive news matches. Removed.
- **RSI division by zero** — `gain / loss` when `loss = 0` produced `inf`. Now clamped to 100.
- **Empty news caching** — Empty results (all feeds down) were cached for 15 minutes, blocking recovery. Now only non-empty results are cached.
- **Missing `encoding="utf-8"` on all file I/O** — Every `open()` call in `persistence.py` now uses `encoding="utf-8"`. Was crashing on Windows with ₹/Unicode characters.
- **Duplicate CSV column headers** — `fieldnames = ["date", "ticker"] + HISTORY_FIELDS` doubled date/ticker columns since `HISTORY_FIELDS` already included them. Fixed.
- **Portfolio badge substring match** — `"SBIN" in "SBINVIT SURGES"` returned True. Now uses word-boundary regex.
- **Missing `import re`** — `re.match()` and `re.search()` were used without importing `re`. Added.
- **NaN avg_vol** — `float(pd.NA)` propagated NaN to volume spike detection. Now guarded with `pd.isna()`.
- **Empty portfolio Back button** — Briefing with no portfolio showed a warning with no way to navigate back. Added "← Back" button.

## [2.2.1] — 2026-06-20

### Changed
- **App loads faster** — Removed unused code paths and consolidated duplicate configuration. Smaller codebase = less to maintain.
- **Reddit: no more local CLI setup** — Removed the `rdt-cli` fallback. Reddit now works exclusively through OAuth (the cloud-friendly path). If you have OAuth env vars set, Reddit posts show up; if not, they're skipped — no extra tools needed.
- **Volume spike detection wired to dashboard** — `detect_volume_spike()` was already tested and ready, now it powers the volume spike badges you see on each holding. No change in behaviour, just cleaner under the hood.

### Fixed
- **Sentiment history CSV had a mislabeled column** — The `neg_count` field in exported CSVs was actually storing neutral headline count instead of negatives. Exports now correctly label negative headline counts.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Portfolio P&L Tracking** — Set entry price when adding a stock. Sidebar shows live P&L (₹ and %) per holding, green for profit, red for loss.
- **Market Heatmap** — Compact 3-column grid in sidebar, every holding color-coded by daily % change.
- **Portfolio News Badges** — 📌 In portfolio badge on headlines that mention your holdings.
- **Volume Spike Detection** — `detect_volume_spike()` flags abnormal trading volume (N× 20-day average).
- **Stagnation Warnings** — `detect_stagnation()` flags stocks stuck in a tight range for 10+ days.

### Changed
- New entry price column in add-ticker row (sidebar)
- Metrics grid on landing page expanded from 4 to 6 columns

### Fixed
- **Trend sparkline blank on first analysis** — `render_sparkline()` now draws a dashed flat line + dot for single data points instead of returning empty SVG. Users see their SmartScore level immediately on first use.

## [2.1.3] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Shareable Snapshot Links** — Every ticker now has a public URL (`?ticker=RELIANCE`) showing SmartScore, signal, and price. Share on Telegram/WhatsApp/X. Full analysis unlocks behind the paywall.
- **Public changelog** — This file. Users can see what's new.
- **Feature request channel** — Feedback form linked in sidebar.

### Fixed
- **ETF 52W proximity crash** — `None` price (ETFs) caused `TypeError` in the proximity badge calculation. Guarded with `_is_valid_num()`.

## [2.1.2] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **ETF NaN prices** — ETFs (NIFTYBEES, GOLDBEES, MIDCAPETF) showed `₹nan` and `nan%` because `float('nan')` is truthy in Python. Added `_nf()` NaN-safe extractor and `_is_valid_num()` guards throughout.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Removed duplicate emoji-to-SVG mapping, consolidated to `get_signal_icon()`
- Collapsed 15-line if/elif sentiment chain to 7-line dict lookup
- Moved lazy imports to module level
- Removed 6 redundant `str()` wrappers

### Fixed
- Dashboard iframe height: formula-based (`2200 + n_news*120`)
- Mobile-responsive CSS breakpoints

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- 504 ticker aliases (was 72)

- Bayesian calibration visible in dashboard
- 270 NSE tickers (was 85)

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06

### Added
- Bayesian source calibration (learns from 👍/👎 votes)
- Optional FinBERT transformer (`USE_FINBERT=true`)
- Lucide SVG icons throughout (replaced Unicode emojis)
