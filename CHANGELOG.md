# Changelog

## [2.2.0] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Portfolio P&L Tracking** — Set entry price when adding a stock. Sidebar shows live P&L (₹ and %) per holding, green for profit, red for loss.
- **Market Heatmap** — Compact 3-column grid in sidebar, every holding color-coded by daily % change.
- **Portfolio News Badges** — 📌 In portfolio badge on headlines that mention your holdings.
- **Volume Spike Detection** — `detect_volume_spike()` flags abnormal trading volume (N× 20-day average).
- **Stagnation Warnings** — `detect_stagnation()` flags stocks stuck in a tight range for 10+ days.

### Changed
- New entry price column in add-ticker row (sidebar)
- Metrics grid on landing page expanded from 4 to 6 columns

### Fixed
- **Trend sparkline blank on first analysis** — `render_sparkline()` now draws a dashed flat line + dot for single data points instead of returning empty SVG. Users see their SmartScore level immediately on first use.

## [2.1.3] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Shareable Snapshot Links** — Every ticker now has a public URL (`?ticker=RELIANCE`) showing SmartScore, signal, and price. Share on Telegram/WhatsApp/X. Full analysis unlocks behind the paywall.
- **Public changelog** — This file. Users can see what's new.
- **Feature request channel** — Feedback form linked in sidebar.

### Fixed
- **ETF 52W proximity crash** — `None` price (ETFs) caused `TypeError` in the proximity badge calculation. Guarded with `_is_valid_num()`.

## [2.1.2] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **ETF NaN prices** — ETFs (NIFTYBEES, GOLDBEES, MIDCAPETF) showed `₹nan` and `nan%` because `float('nan')` is truthy in Python. Added `_nf()` NaN-safe extractor and `_is_valid_num()` guards throughout.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Removed duplicate emoji-to-SVG mapping, consolidated to `get_signal_icon()`
